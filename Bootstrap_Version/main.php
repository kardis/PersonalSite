						Disclaimer: The site is designed so that attempting to use the back button or refresh options will not take you to the previous page or reload the current page respectively.  This was done as a security procation and for trying out a new idea I helped develop at my work.  It primarily helps with cross site scripting attacks and people attempting to view the source code of a site.
