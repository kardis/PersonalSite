					<p class="tab">
						I am someone who loves computers and meeting new people.  Like most computer geeks I have gone through that awkard stage of not being very social but in this point in my life I want to meet as many people as possible and learn even more.

					<p class="tab">
						This website is for my personal benefit of displaying my resume and code examples for prospective employers.  If you have any questions please use the <strong><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></strong> link in the navigation bar to contact me. I will be using a mixture of Twitter Bootstrap and Drupal in the creation of this site mixed in obviously with PHP and HTML and CSS.

						I started the creation of this website at the end of my Junior year, Spring of 2012, at Oklahoma State University and will be adding onto it over the summer while I work for IT Security at OSU.
