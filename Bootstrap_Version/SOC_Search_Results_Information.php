			<h2>Main Page</h2>
			<p>This is the code I created personally for one of the internal search engine's that the IT Security office at Oklahoma State University uses for translating the external IP to internal IP resolution.  It does provide for some other options but we primarily use it for this function. This was the first page I had done in over 12 years so it may not be the most clean cut code for what it does.
			<h2>Results Page</h2>
			<p>This page is the results page of the Phoenix Search Page I created. We will be using AJAX and PHP to pull information from the search and place the results within the div container of the table that the code creates.</p>
